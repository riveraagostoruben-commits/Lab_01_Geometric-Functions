# Lab_01_Geometric-Functions

**Overview**

The program is designed as a menu-driven utility that allows users to interactively calculate the area of a circle or the area of a rectangle. It emphasizes code modularity by separating calculation logic into distinct, reusable functions.

**Features**

- **Modular Design:** Uses separate functions for calculating the area of a circle and a rectangle, keeping the main() function clean and organized.
- **Function Prototypes:** Demonstrates the correct use of forward declarations for functions.
- **Input Validation:** Includes logic to handle specific geometric inputs, such as radius, length, and width.
- **Mathematical Constants:** Implements a precise value for PI ($3.14159$) for accurate circular calculations.

**Experiment & Results**

**Geometric Calculations**
- **The program implements the following mathematical formulas:**
- **Area of a Circle:** $Area = \pi \times r^2$.
- **Area of a Rectangle:** $Area = length \times width$.

**Sample Outputs**

- **Based on the lab report, the program successfully executed the following test cases:**
- **Circle Test:** Inputting a radius results in the correct area calculation using the defined PI constant.
- **Rectangle Test:** Inputting a length and width returns the product of those two values.
- **Menu System:** The program correctly navigates between options and terminates when the user chooses to exit.

**Technologies**

- **Language:** C++.
- **Libraries:** iostream for standard I/O operations.
- **Concepts:** Function Prototypes, Value-Returning Functions, Switch-Case Statements, and Structured Programming.
